#' Decision-level cross-sectional time-series data by member state and case
#' type
#' 
#' This dataset includes aggregated data on the number of decisions per stage
#' of the infringement procedure per member state per year (cross-sectional
#' time-series data) broken down by case type (noncommunication vs
#' nonconformity). There is one observation per member state per year per
#' decision stage per case type (2002-2020), excluding state-years where the
#' state was not a member of the EU.
#' 
#' @format A data frame with 10 variables:
#' \describe{
#' \item{key_id}{\\code\{numeric\}. An ID number that uniquely identifies each
#' observation in the dataset. }
#' \item{year}{\\code\{numeric\}. The year the decision was issued by the
#' Commission.}
#' \item{member_state_id}{\\code\{numeric\}. An ID number that uniquely
#' identifies each member state. This ID number is assigned when member states
#' are sorted by accession date and then alphabetically. }
#' \item{member_state}{\\code\{string\}. The name of the member state that the
#' Commission opened the case against. }
#' \item{member_state_code}{\\code\{string\}. A two letter code assigned by
#' the Commission that uniquely identifies each member state. }
#' \item{case_type_id}{\\code\{numeric\}. An ID number that uniquely
#' identifies each type of state aid cases. Coded \code{1} for
#' noncommunication cases, which are cases that relate to a member state
#' failing to notify the Commission that it has transposed a directive by the
#' stated deadline. Coded \code{2} for nonconformity cases, which are cases
#' that relate to a member state incorrectly transposing a directive. }
#' \item{case_type}{\\code\{string\}. The type of the infringement case. There
#' are two types of cases. Coded \code{noncommunication} for cases that relate
#' to a member state failing to notify the Commission that it has transposed a
#' directive by the stated deadline. Coded \code{nonconformity} for cases that
#' relate to a member state incorrectly transposing a directive. }
#' \item{decision_stage_id}{\\code\{numeric\}. An ID number that uniquely
#' identifies each decision stage in the infringement procedure. Coded
#' \code{1} for letters of formal notice under Article 258 of the Treaty on
#' the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), coded \code{2} for reasoned
#' opinions under Article 258, coded \code{3} for referrals to the Court under
#' Article 258, coded \code{4} for letters of formal notice under Article 260,
#' coded \code{5} for reasoned opinions under Article 260, and coded \code{6}
#' for referrals to the Court under Article 264}
#' \item{decision_stage}{\\code\{string\}. The decision stage of the
#' infringement procedure. Possible values include: \code{Letter of formal
#' notice (Article 258)}, \code{Reasoned opinion (Article 259)},
#' \code{Referral to the Court (Article 258)}, \code{Letter of formal notice
#' (Article 260)}, \code{Reasoned opinion (Article 260)}, and \code{Referral
#' to the Court (Article 260)}. }
#' \item{count_decisions}{\\code\{numeric\}. A count of the number of
#' decisions made by the Commission in infringement cases at this level of
#' aggregation.}
